            One place attorneys sometimes find their name is within online directories. That might not be a surprise if you know your name is there. But what about when you find it attached to directories that you’ve never visited?
Several directories may have taken your name already and are using it. If you don’t have an active online web presence that you own and control, these listings may rank closer to the top of search engine results. On the surface, that can seem like a good thing. And it can be positive. But if you appear in directory listings that a) you don’t have control over and b) don’t provide any information about you, that can be a problem.
Let’s use a referral as an example. Someone who has been referred to your law firm may conduct a Google search specifically for your name. If your name is being used a directory such as Avvo, and you haven’t yet claimed your profile, that potential client will likely see you in search engine results. They could be looking for something as simple as your contact information, or they may want to know more about you and your practice.
They’ll find that directory result. They’ll see that your profile is empty. And they’ll also see many of your competitors. Many of those competitors may have a complete profile on a directory with lots of useful information about themselves. An empty profile can send the wrong message to a potential client who wants to know more about you. With nothing to look at on your profile, potential clients are likely to examine competing profiles to help them make a decision. That can mean lost business for your firm.
Between your empty profile and the robust profile of a competitor, a potential client who needs to make a decision about who to contact is likely to use a complete profile to assist them in that decision-making process. Your potential clients cannot work with the information they do not have. Plus, a sparse web presence — whether you lack a content-rich law firm website, or you haven’t yet claimed your profile on certain legal directories, or you’ve avoided social media — can send red flags to web visitors who expect to find you there.
This is a mistake that’s easy to correct. Claiming these profiles doesn’t take much time and can help streamline your web presence so that, no matter where a client finds you online, they find consistent information about you and your firm. But attorneys who don’t take the time to put themselves in control of their names may be losing business to competitors that have already taken this step. You may not have ownership over these directories and may not be able to control that these directories use your name. But, you can control what information a potential client has when they find that listing.
Attorneys should assume that your potential client will likely do online research about your law firm before they ever contact your firm or walk into your office.
If you have 10 minutes, find those listings and claim them for yourself. Take the time to fill these profiles with information about you that you want potential clients to see. When it comes to adding yourself to online directories, be selective about the ones that you choose. All directories may not have the same value for attorneys so it’s important to choose the ones that your potential clients value and are likely to use.
To learn what criteria can help you select the most useful directories, read our blog on choosing legal directories.
